Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
his lab is designed to give you an understanding of Principal Components Analysis (PCA). PCA has been called one of the most valuable results from applied linear algebra. PCA is used abundantly in all forms of analysis - from neuroscience to computer graphics - because it is a simple, non-parametric method of extracting relevant information from confusing data sets.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a linear dimensionality reduction technique that can be utilized for extracting information from a high-dimensional space by projecting it into a lower-dimensional sub-space. It tries to preserve the essential parts that have more variation of the data and remove the non-essential parts with fewer variation.
